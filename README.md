# Mission

Our solution is essentially a facebook for the unemployed and for the owners of the bankrupt companies. So that they can find each other.

Our network will connect the job-seeking people and the sinking employers based on their reputation - the snapshot from just a couple of months ago.

Through this database, venture capital and government recovery funds could find the matched pairs of employees and employers to revive the most important areas of the damaged economy.
